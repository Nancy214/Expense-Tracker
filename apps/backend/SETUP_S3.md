# AWS S3 Setup for Profile Picture Uploads

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account
2. S3 Bucket created
3. IAM User with S3 permissions

## Step 1: Create S3 Bucket

1. Go to AWS S3 Console
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Choose a unique bucket name (e.g., `my-expense-tracker-profile-pics`)
4. Select your preferred region
5. Keep default settings for versioning and encryption
6. Create the bucket

## Step 2: Configure Bucket for Public Access

1. Go to your bucket â†’ Permissions tab
2. Edit "Block public access" settings
3. Uncheck "Block all public access" (since we need public read access for profile pictures)
4. Save changes

## Step 3: Create IAM User

1. Go to AWS IAM Console
2. Create a new user with programmatic access
3. Attach the following policy (or create a custom one):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:

```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
AWS_REGION=your-region (e.g., us-east-1)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## Step 5: Test the Setup

1. Start the backend server
2. Go to the Profile page
3. Upload a profile picture
4. Check the console logs for S3 upload confirmation

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "AWS not configured" warnings, check your .env file
- If S3 upload fails, verify your IAM permissions
- If images don't display, check the bucket's public access settings

## Security Notes

- The profile pictures are stored with public read access
- Each file has a unique bcrypt-hashed filename
- Old profile pictures are automatically deleted when new ones are uploaded
